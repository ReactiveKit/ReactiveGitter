Pull requests are very welcome! 

Any new code or feature that is added should be tested.

In general, we like these [guidelines](https://swift.org/contributing/#contributing-code) for contributing to an open source project.
Though, we will be honest in saying that these rules will not be tirelessly defended.

If you run into bugs, design problems, or have a suggestion, please create a Github issue.
